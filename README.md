🚀 Excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard project! 🚀

I recently developed a comprehensive dashboard for D-Mart, showcasing key insights such as:

📊 Top & Bottom Categories – Visualizing the best and least performing categories, helping businesses focus on growth and optimization.

💰 Sales Overview – 1M total sales with detailed breakdowns of the top brands and categories.

🛒 Discount and Pricing Analysis – Displaying brand-wise price, discount percentage, and more for better decision-making.

This project helped me sharpen my skills in data visualization and storytelling using Power BI, making data not only insightful but actionable.

🔍 I am currently seeking opportunities in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. If you're looking for someone with hands-on experience in Power BI, I would love to connect!
